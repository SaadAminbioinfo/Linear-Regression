# Linear-Regression

In the following notebook each and every point will be discss in Jupoyter Notebook as well in the attach text file document too.
The Dataset we are using here in our notebook and also attached the csv file in the github whch contains a multiple attributes of Height/Weight/Gender which contains 10000 entries.

Machine Learning
### - Supervised Machine Learning (data + labels)
         - Regression    (Regression, Lasso, Ridge)
                - Simple Linear Regression
                - Multiple Linear Regression
                - Polynomial Regression
                
         - Classification
                - Binary Classification (0,1)(T/F)(CAT/DOG)
                - Multiclassification   (More than 2 classes)
### - Unsupervised Machine Learning (data)
                - Clustering 
                - Dimensionality Reduction
               
### - Semi Supervised Machine Learning (data + labels (auto encoded) )
### - Reinforcement Learning

Regression
    - Findind depending variable values using independent varuiable/es 

Here we perform a simple regression analysis model 
and also the short intro given to the random pickings of AI in the given nunbers that how the different tasks perform in random states and give the different results.
Also perform the Accuracy , Mean Square error , F2 score.
At the End we take the inout from the user and predicting the Weight accoreding to the given Height to input from user.
